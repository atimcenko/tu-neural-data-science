# Neural Data Science coding assigments
**Collaborators**: Aleksejs Timcenko, Ali Gholamzadeh, Shweta Prasad (?)

## Notes for collaborators

1. Clone the repository
2. Create your branch
3. Modify your .gitignore if needed. No need to push data files and .ipynb_checkpoints/. Please create missing directory structure yourself (e.g. add data/ folder)
3. Use your own ipynb notebooks (e.g. CodingLabX_YourName.ipynb)
4. Commit and push to your branch. We will merge (pull-request) our works into 'main' and a single (perhaps still multiple) notebooks before the deadline.
