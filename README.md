# Neural Data Science coding assigments
**Collaborators**: Aleksejs Timcenko, Ali Gholamzadeh, Nitin Sharma

## Notes for collaborators

1. Clone the repository
2. Set the origin to push via `git remote add origin git@github.com:atimcenko/tu-neural-data-science.git`
3. Create your branch via `git switch -c YourBranchName`
5. Modify your `.gitignore` if needed. No need to push data files and `.ipynb_checkpoints/`. Please create missing directory structure yourself (e.g. add `data/` folder)
6. Use your own ipynb notebooks (e.g. `CodingLabX_YourName.ipynb`)
7. Use `git add .` and `git commit -m "commit message"` to save your changes into your branch locally on the repository.
8. Push to your remote branch via `git push origin YourBranchName`.
9. If you have a solid chunk of work done that could be useful to other collaborators, log in into the github, enter the repository and locate the "Compare and pull-request" button. Merge your branch into `main`. If everything done correctly, no merge conflict will be present.
10. To keep you local repository up to date use: `git fetch` from YourBranch. To merge remote main into local YourBranch use `git switch main` and `git pull` to receive the latest remote commits from  main. 
11. To update your local feature branch with changes from main use `git merge main`.
