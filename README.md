# Neural Data Science coding assigments
**Collaborators**: Aleksejs Timcenko, Ali Gholamzadeh

## Notes for collaborators

1. Clone the repository
2. Set the origin to push via 'git remote -add origin git remote add origin git@github.com:atimcenko/tu-neural-data-science.git'
3. Create your branch via 'git switch -c YourBranchName'
5. Modify your .gitignore if needed. No need to push data files and .ipynb_checkpoints/. Please create missing directory structure yourself (e.g. add data/ folder)
6. Use your own ipynb notebooks (e.g. CodingLabX_YourName.ipynb)
7. Commit and push to your branch via 'git push origin YourBranchName'.
8. If you have a solid chunk of work done that could be useful to other collaborators, log in into the github, enter the repository and locate the "Compare and pull-request" button. Merge your branch into 'main'. If everything done correctly, no merge conflict will be present.
